# Dangerous-Dice

#### This is a simple game made in 48 hours for the 2022 GMTK Game Jam, which had the theme of "Roll of The Dice"

Dangerous Dice is about finding all the dice on the map, other than a randomly selected one, or the dangerous one.
You have 30 seconds to find it, and then, points are added or subtracted, the timer is reset, new dice spawn and a new dangerous die is chosen.
